      "title": "What is Cold Press Forming?",
      "content": "Cold forming is a high-speed manufacturing process where metal is shaped at room temperature. Using immense pressure from our specialized press machines, we force a metal blank into a die to create the desired fitting shape. This method avoids heating the material, which preserves and even enhances its structural properties, resulting in a stronger, more precise final product."
